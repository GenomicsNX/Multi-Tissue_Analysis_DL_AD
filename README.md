#Integrative Transcriptome-Wide Analysis for Alzheimer’s Disease

This repository contains the code and methods used in the research paper "Integrative Transcriptome-Wide and Multimodal Deep Learning Analyses Reveal APOE-Associated Gene Expression in Alzheimer’s Disease". The study utilizes multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and deep learning techniques to identify key genes and potential drug repositioning candidates related to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
